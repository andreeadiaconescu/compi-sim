Getting Started
---------------

The main function is `HGFtutorial_generate_task.m`. The perceptual models used are `tapas_hgf_binary.m` and `tapas_hgf_ar1_binary.m`. The response model is specific to the Inferring on the Intentions of Others (IOIO) task and entitled `softmax_social.m`.
These simulations utilise scripts from the HGF toolbox (TAPAS; Mathys et al., 2014).
